    // TODO: Credit card's balance history. It is a requirement that the dates in the balanceHistory 
    //       list must be in chronological order, with the most recent date appearing first in the list. 
    //       Additionally, the last object in the "list" must have a date value that matches today's date, 
    //       since it represents the current balance of the credit card.
    //       This means that if today is 04-16, and the list begin as empty, you receive a payload for 04-13,
    //       you should fill the list up until 04-16. For example:
    //       [
    //         {date: '2023-04-10', balance: 800},
    //         {date: '2023-04-11', balance: 1000},
    //         {date: '2023-04-12', balance: 1200},
    //         {date: '2023-04-13', balance: 1100},
    //         {date: '2023-04-16', balance: 900},
    //       ]
    // ADDITIONAL NOTE: For the balance history, you can use any data structure that you think is appropriate.
    //        It can be a list, array, map, pq, anything. However, there are some suggestions:
    //        1. Retrieval of a balance of a single day should be fast
    //        2. Traversal of the entire balance history should be fast
    //        3. Insertion of a new balance should be fast
    //        4. Deletion of a balance should be fast
    //        5. It is possible that there are gaps in between dates (note the 04-13 and 04-16)
    //        6. In the condition that there are gaps, retrieval of "closest **previous**" balance date should also be fast. Aka, given 4-15, return 4-13 entry tuple
